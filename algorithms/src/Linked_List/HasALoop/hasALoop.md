This algorithm uses the slow and fast pointer technique (also known as Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm)
to efficiently detect the presence of a loop in the linked list.

1. Initialize two pointers: slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the list.

2. Start a while loop that continues until both fast is null and the next node of fast is null:

3. Move slow one step ahead (i.e., slow = slow.next).

4. Move fast two steps ahead (i.e., fast = fast.next.next).

5. Check if slow is equal to fast. If they are equal, it means the list has a loop, so return true.

6. If the while loop ends without finding a loop, return false.
